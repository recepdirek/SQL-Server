Windows authenticated user creation. It should have remote desktop access ( you can assign it to Administrators group or Remote Desktop Users according to requirement)



Create an admin user on SQL Server:

Create a window user





Sample: 

USE [master]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [Server\recep] FROM WINDOWS;
ALTER SERVER ROLE [sysadmin] ADD MEMBER [Server\recep]
GO



with these configuration when user access to the server, it will see and use all databases.







Create a Read only user on SQL Server: 



Create a windows user:





USE [master]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [Server\read_only_db] FROM WINDOWS;











you need to give read only access to the user on database level



USE DBname
GO
 
CREATE USER read_only_db FOR LOGIN [Server\read_only_db];

CREATE ROLE read_only;
grant select on [dbo].[table_name] to read_only;

 ALTER ROLE read_only ADD MEMBER read_only_db;











SQL SERVER AUTHENTICATED USER:

use master 

CREATE LOGIN  new_user WITH PASSWORD='dfasfsfdsdf'
GO



under exact database: 

user db_name

CREATE USER new_user FOR LOGIN new_user 
GO
